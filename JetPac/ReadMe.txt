Read Me for Jetpac:

You're stranded on a strange planet full of floating fireballs. It is up to you to reassemble the pieces of your ship so you can return home.

Rule: You have three lives and the ship must be put back together in “logical” order. You can carry only one piece at a time. You have a jetpac to help you evade enemies. Each time you get hit you lose a life, when you hit zero lives, the game is over.

Controls:

Up: uses your jetpac to make you climb higher (don't forget about gravity).
Left: moves you left
Right: moves you right

Extra info: This is my adaptation of the old jetpac game, you may know it as the game that was featured in Donkey Kong 64 on the arcade machine in Kranky's Hut.
